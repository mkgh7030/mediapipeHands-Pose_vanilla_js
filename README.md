<h1>Remote PID Control for a Distance-Sensitive Robot</h1> 

### Winter 2019

<p>In the following, a translation of the report of my bachelor's thesis (“Final Project 1” in Electrical Engineering – Control) is provided. The original report was written in Persian and was successfully evaluated, resulting in a high grade of 19.5 out of 20 in 2019</p>

### Abstract
<p>The objective of this project is to develop a distance-sensitive robot capable of maintaining a safe distance from objects in front of it while responding to input commands for movement and positioning via a mobile device. The robot's control is achieved through a PID controller, which
receives control variables and distance information from a smartphone application. Using an Arduino microcontroller, the robot is powered by a battery. An LCD display, with 16 characters, is integrated into the robot to provide visual feedback of the sensor output, completing the control loop. This robot holds crucial applications in distance maintenance technology, such as maintaining safe distances between vehicles and even in autonomous and intelligent strollers to ensure a safe separation from the carrier.</p>
